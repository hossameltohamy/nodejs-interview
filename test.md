# NodeJS Candidate Test

## Basic knowledge questions

- What are Promises in Node.js?

- What is callback hell?

- What tools can be used to assure consistent style?

- What is REPL? What purpose it is used for?

- What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?

- List types of Http requests supported by Node.js?

- Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?

- What is your favourite HTTP framework and why?

- What is difference between JavaScript and Node.js?

- What is TypeScript? Do you use it? Why / why not?

## Problem solving

You get an error report from testing crew - User API doesn't return "Test User" data for ID: 1.
Code is in this repository.

**Find out why, fix it and write report on why did it happen.**

## Create something

Use Vue.js and create simple To-Do app with backend (save to file, UI / UX not important).  TypeScript preferred but not necessary.
